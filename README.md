# cppsandbox

C++ code snippets covering best coding practices and features of C++20 and C++23.

## Running the code

Each code snippet is in its own directory. To run the code, navigate to the directory and run the `build.sh` script. The script will compile the code and create an executable. Run the executable to see the output.

```bash
> cd vector
> ../build.sh
> ./main
```
